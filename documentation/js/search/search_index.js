new robot method is to simply do it.  \nFor this reason we have added a dummy robot method in the code, considered all dependencies and documented everything.The dummy robot method is also included in the deliverd code, so developers can see the dependencies in the actual code and only need to change the name of the robot method to be added, its dependencies and properties.   \nThis section explains step by step which classes and methods need to be adapted and which need to be newly created.\nThe changes are shown using code snipets and there is always a link to the dependent class, component, service, model etc. \nMain Changes to be made to add new robot method\n\ncreate new model NewMethodModel\nadd new model in workflow model   \ncreate new component NewMethodComponent\nadd
