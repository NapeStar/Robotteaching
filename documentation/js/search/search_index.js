a web-based user interface for programming mobile manipulators like CHIMERA.The so-called \"Teach-In\" procedure is used to program the robot. \nThe web application is based on the \"MEAN\" Stack

Angular applications. Basically it generates a static documentation for the application. \nFor this application the documentation was extended. Under Additional Documentation you will find detailed instructions for adding new robot methods. \nIn the manner of a tutorial every single step is explained in detail. Screenshots and direct links to the affected code passages help the developer to understand how to extend the program. \nTo install Compodoc enter   \n\nnpm install -g @compodoc/compodoc  \n\nin terminal. A detailed description you find here.    \nIf you change the code and want to generate an updated documentation enter:\n\ncompodoc -p tsconfig.json -s -a screenshots --includes additional-doc  \n\nThis command also includes the part of the Additional Documentation in the updated documentation.  \nEnvironments Variables\nThe URL Address for connecting to backend can be set in environments files.   \nLink to Environment Files variables.Path to directory \"src/environments/environment.ts\".Path to directory \"src/environments/environment.prod.ts\".      \nComponents Structure\nIn the following, the structure of the components will be illustrated.   \nWorkflows Table -

Therefore we have added a dummy robot method \"NewMethod\" in code. \n   \nThe dummy robot method is also included in the deliverd code, so developers can see the dependencies in the actual code and only need to change the name of the robot method to be added, its dependencies and properties.   \nThis section explains step by step which classes and methods need to be adapted and which need to be newly created.\nThe changes are shown using code snipets and there is always a link to the dependent class, component, service, model etc. \nMain Changes to be made to add new robot method\n\ncreation of new model\n\nadd model to workflow\n\ncreate new component\n\nadd routes\n\nupdate all routing methods\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/steps-adding-new-method.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/steps-adding-new-method.html","title":"additional-page - Steps adding new method","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nNecessary steps for adding a new robot method in Angular project\n\ncreation of new model\n\nadd model to workflow\n\ncreate new component\n\nadd routes\n\nupdate all routing methods\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/steps-adding-new-method/1.-creation-of-new-model.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/steps-adding-new-method/1.-creation-of-new-model.html","title":"additional-page - 1.
